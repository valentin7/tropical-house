					<p>The term “Tropical House” began as a joke by Australian producer Thomas Jack. He was the first to use the #Tropical House hashtag on Soundcloud for his remix of Down Under - Men at Work, Chuck Norris Dub  in 2013.</p>

					<p>He then started a mixtape series he dubbed as Thomas Jack Presents: Tropical House in 2014.</p>
					<iframe width="100%" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/140276843&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
					<p> The Tropical House style is now present in top charts all around the world.  In an interview for the popular Thissongissick  music blog, Thomas Jack mentioned “The genre Tropical House was kind of a joke at the start. One of my mates told me to label my music under a genre. I loved summer vibes and the beach so I thought tropical house would be a cool name. The genre, for me, is more of a vibe which seems to be coming through certain artist's music recently.” The other artists that had started playing with similar easy-going, tropical-style instruments fused with relaxed deep house beats include Bakermat, Klangkarussel, and Robin Schulz. Tropical House is a subset of of Deep House and  Thomas Jack cites it as a major influence “Deep House has had a huge influence on my music. It has similarities to my music and I tend to play a lot of it in my sets. People like Claptone, Andhim, Kolombo, Pleasurekraft and Duke Dumont have some epic tunes and have given me a lot of ideas for my music.”  However, some of Tropical House’s defining characteristics such as a relaxed vibe with no big drops and inclusion of acoustics such as folk guitars started emerging as early as in 2009 with hits such as Edward Maya’s Stereo Love.</p>

					<p>
					Tropical House quickly turned from a Soundcloud hashtag to a widespread hit-producing style. While Thomas  Jack coined the term, is considered the founder of the movement, and is supported by a roster that includes Klingande, LCAW, Autograf and Bakermat, the undisputed pioneer is Norway's Kygo (Kyree Gørvell-Dahll). Kygo was born in Singapore and enrolled in piano lessons at the age of 6 — he stopped the lessons at 16 when he started producing music with Logic and a MIDI keyboard.  At only 23 he had over 150 million plays on Soundcloud alone. Kygo then signed a deal with Ultra Records and Sony International. He also spent summer 2014 playing four sold-out shows at four different venues over three days in New York City and was selected to replace Avicii for his headline slot at TomorrowWorld. His single "Firestone" has over 370 million <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Sc-ir2UwGU"> views on YouTube</a> (this wouldn't play on my website) with an additional 400 million plays on the music streaming service Spotify, as of August 2016. At 24, Kygo became the fastest artist to hit 1 billion streams on Spotify.

					<p>An inflection point for Tropical House’s popularity was when 20-year old Felix Jaehn remixed remixed OMI’s “Cheerleader” in 2015.

					<p>His saxophone-infused remix brought tropical house into the iTunes and Spotify top ten in 18 and 14 countries respectively, reaching the top spot in Australia, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. The style is now prevalent in one of today’s biggest pop hits, as evidenced by the Caribbean plucks and liberal use of pan flute on Justin Bieber’s “What Do You Mean?”.</p>

					<p> Tropical House father Thomas Jack thinks the style has gone too far — “a lot people started copying off it and started changing the style of it. People would go grabbing, like, 90s pop songs and putting flutes over them,” he says, before dropping the definitive blow: “It became so annoying that I’m over it and I don’t even wanna do it anymore.” Jack prefers to stay less commercial.
					</p>
					<p>Now on the more commercial side, Kygo also didn’t start with a classic DJ story. When Kygo started “he actually didn’t know how to DJ so we didn’t even focus on shows,” said his 22-year-old manager Myles Shear. “My first eight months of managing him, we didn’t play a single show, which was actually incredible because it allowed us to build online hype and it allowed us to build an online fan base.” His Tropical House sounds register at around 100 beats-per-minute–slower than the traditional big room EDM tempo of 128 b.p.m. In some ways, that’s because Kygo has never truly been a dance artist, building his reputation through online blogs and not on club dance floors. When asked how he “There are no beaches and summers are short in Norway so maybe I was sitting in my room dreaming about summer and dreaming about beaches,” he said before a January show in San Francisco, where he sold out two nights at the 7,000-person capacity Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. “Maybe that was the reason why I started making that music.” Given that beaches and summer are so desired, that might also the reason people love the Tropical House vibe so much.
					</p>
					<p>The arrangements are easy-going and casual; the melodies are often sweet and easy to listen to, way more melodic than usual EDM tunes. There’s even a parody clip with Family Guy’s Petter Griffin portraying the “summer house music” vibes.</p>
					<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_aDfktv8zU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>Furthermore, the beats aren’t as heavy and don’t pound as hard as compared to other EDM genres. Naturally, there’s also a tropical vibe and flavor in Tropical House tracks. You can find tropical-type instruments such as flutes, folk guitars, horns, steel drums, and marimbas. Unlike other EDM tracks, there’s hardly any ‘big drops’ in Tropical House. The feel is laid-back and chill, with BPMs in the 100-115 range. There’s also plenty of Tropical House tracks that use the pentatonic scale for their melodies. One reason may be that the pentatonic scale is usually very easily remembered and thus poises to be a great hook.</p>
					<p>There’s also a pop and “organic” feeling that comes from the combination of lush instrument pads with edgy synths and the addition of non-electronic instruments like guitars, saxophones, horns. Although Kygo, Thomas Jack, Felix Jaehn, and others have been the artists that have propelled Tropical House to its international popularity, the less-known Tom “Matoma” is an epitome of a Tropical House producer. His sounds are probably the best at capturing the warmth at the heart of the trend.</p>
					<iframe width="100%" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sb3XfrCtjVU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>Although new, The Tropical House style seems ageless.  While you’ll hardly find 40-year-old moms dancing to Skrillex’s dubstep, plenty of them were gyrating when Kygo played at The Ellen DeGeneres Show in January, 2016. Kygo’s remix of “Sexual Healing,” which, when played in San Francisco’s Bill Graham’s cavernous auditorium, elicited yelps of delight from the young teens and their chaperoning mothers.</p>
					<iframe width="100%" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WqPnZ4I9IdU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>Kygo is diplomatically optimistic about tropical house's future. "There will always be people who support the genre and allow it to live on...that's not to say that tropical house won't change with the times and incorporate other elements into itself, because I'm sure it will. It's only just the beginning for this style of music, and there is so much more to be created in this realm. I'm also really excited to see what the future will bring in terms of new artists and collaborations, because that will inevitably shape the future of the sound to some extent.” Thomas Jack shares similar sentiments, who tells GQ "it's hard to know where it's going, but what's essential for the growth of the genre is other young people being inspired to join onto it, and then it's up to what those people do.” As it is with most new music genres, artists simply make music and get inspired by new techniques and styles, then someone coins a term, and suddenly it’s a widespread phenomenon. Tropical House rose from a Soundcloud hashtag to an ubiquitous music style that brings beach and summer vibes to people all over the world.
